Conway's Game of Life in Java implementation

Hi !

I have made this project in VHDL with high parallelism so all cells are computed simultaneously, but this was a long time ago. 
So I remake this project while teaching someone how to code in Java because it is funny. 
You can try to edit it for multithreading. Any other details here [Conway's Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

It actually needs some work in side cells also on my //TODO list is to interact with mouse.

Have fun :)
